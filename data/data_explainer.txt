Github has a file size upload restriction, and the Bixi datasets are extremely large. To get around this restriction, the datasets are available at the google drive link here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iXZRpnqqPB-p0SiQs8PmBnktTJlV16Su?usp=sharing. Anyone with a Wentworth Institute Technology email address can access the link. Copy the files over from the downloaded folder into the data folder in the repository.
